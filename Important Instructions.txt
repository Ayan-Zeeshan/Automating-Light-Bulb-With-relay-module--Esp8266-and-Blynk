I am strictly advising you to follow the pdf file I have given on Github a video will be uploaded on youtube channel: youtube.com/@AyanUtech
Important Instructions!:

• You might have a NodeMCU 1.0, so to check which Esp8266 you are using check the name on the chip if the name on it is the Esp-12F,
it is the Generic Esp8266 else if it is has the Esp8266MOD chip it is probably the NodeMCU 1.0 (Esp-12E)

• You should have the Blynk library- by Volodymyr Shymansky download on your arduino as well as the Esp8266 board manager, if you 
haven't done so, then use this link to learn how to do so: https://randomnerdtutorials.com/how-to-install-esp8266-board-arduino-ide/

• Its recommended to download the Arduino IDE 1.8.19, because the latest IDE, which is currently 2.1.1 is very buggy and will 
always show you errors, the latest IDEs now matter what always show you errors.

• You can also contact me for help at: ayanzeeshan2158@gmail.com or +92 333 0300310 or if you want to take a robotronics and then and IoT
course from me too.

• Also, It is compulsory for you to use the rubber or silicon gloves for proper insulation.

• You must use the help of an adult, if you are a minor or underage (to be precise).

• And lastly if you wish to put the wire from light bulb to relay into the NC pin, just replace the functions: digitalWrite(Led, HIGH); and
digitalWrite(Led, HIGH); with each other in the if(param.asInt()==1){} condition.

• And also I know I am going off topic but I am internationally certified by the University of Michigan and Irvine. You can check my certificates
